/// How to search, around the dataset's own guidance; `{many}` is the dataset's features.
const HOW: &str = r#"- Read pages by asking about them: `web read <url> which links lead to {many} or ArcGIS REST
  services?` answers in a few lines with the URLs. An open-data page links its service ("View API
  Resources", "I want to use this", a …/FeatureServer/0 URL); a web viewer's page or config names its
  services. Do not `web get` HTML pages: `web get` is for JSON endpoints, with --grep.
- `arcgis probe` a services directory, then a service, then its layer of {many}.
- Neighbouring counties often share a host or vendor (Schneider/Beacon, Tyler, Vision, a regional
  consortium, a state portal): try theirs first.
- Prefer the official layer: the county's or city's own, its state's, or a vendor's serving it for
  them. ArcGIS Online also holds copies people uploaded themselves (personal items, class projects,
  mirrors); use one only when nothing official is queryable, and submit it with "official": false
  and whose copy it is in "notes".
- Then `spec validate '<json>'`, read the report, fix what it names, and `spec submit` once it passes.

A county is unavailable only if, after a real search, its {many} are not published as a queryable
service or file. A viewer that draws {many} from a public ArcGIS service is available: use that
service. Never work around logins, keys, captchas, or terms that forbid automated access; those make a
county unavailable.

Be efficient: every command costs time, and `--help` on any command explains it. Do not repeat a
command you already ran."#;
