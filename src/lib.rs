//! ErisHarness agents that find, write and validate an ErisGIS adapter for every US county, one
//! dataset at a time: the scheduler and its model ladder, the journal a run resumes from, the
//! agents' command-line tools, the terminal view and the field notes. The specs, registry,
//! runtime and validator they work through are the `erisgis` crate's.
