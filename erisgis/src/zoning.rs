//! Zoning districts: the polygons a zoning ordinance assigns each district to, with the
//! district's code and name. Counties zone their unincorporated land and cities and towns zone
//! their own, so a county may need several adapters. Every feature read gets a `class`, a broad
//! use guessed from its code and name, so maps can color districts the same way everywhere.

            offices often publish with a jurisdiction field. Otherwise submit the county's own zoning layer, then \
            the zoning layers of its largest cities, up to five specs in all, each with its own id and coverage \
            {\"counties\": [\"<your county's FIPS>\"]}. Your job ends when you reply after submitting what you \
            found, or when `spec unavailable` records that the county has none.",
        state_goal: "You look for ONE public layer of zoning district polygons that covers a whole US state (a \
            statewide compilation of local zoning). When you find one, validate a spec for it with coverage \
            {\"states\": [\"XX\"]} using `statewide_spec validate`, and save it with `statewide_spec submit`. Few \

  Zoning, Zoning Districts or Base Zoning, by a county's GIS office, a city's planning department or a
  regional planning commission. Start with `arcgis search zoning`, then
  `web search <county> county <state> zoning gis`, and for a city `web search <city> <state> zoning gis`.
- Pick the polygon layer of base zoning districts: not overlay districts, not future land use or
  comprehensive plan land use (plans, not zoning), not zoning cases or rezoning petitions, not parcels.
  A parcel layer whose attributes carry each parcel's zoning is a last resort when no district layer
  exists; say so in \"notes\".
- Map zone to the district's code (R-1, C-2, AG). In a layer holding several jurisdictions, map
  jurisdiction to the attribute naming each.
- Many counties do not zone, and in some states counties cannot. Such a county is none-exists only
  if no city or town in it publishes zoning either; when one does, submit theirs. Zoning published
  only as PDF maps or images is viewer-only.",
