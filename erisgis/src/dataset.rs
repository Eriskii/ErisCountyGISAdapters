//! A dataset is one kind of public GIS layer that counties publish, such as tax parcels or
//! zoning districts. The specs, registry, runtime, validator and lookup are the same for every
//! dataset; what differs is described here: the normalized fields a spec maps, how the validator
//! samples and judges a layer, how features become map features, and what agents are told to
//! look for. Each dataset's registry is its own folder, named after it.
